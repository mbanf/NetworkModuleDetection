## One sentence summary

We propose a highly scalable heuristic approach that recursively integrates graph sparsification and clustering for fast and community structure preserving network module detection. 

## Introduction

Many community detection algorithms for complex networks have been presented over the last decades. However, determining the quality of individual algorithms, in terms of accuracy and computing time, remains an open issue (Yang, 2016). In order to obtain optimal clustering performance with respect to both criteria, especially for densely connected and large networks, graph sparsification approaches should be considered as general preprocessing steps to any clustering approach. This leads to the critical problem to efficiently identify edges that are more likely to lie within rather than between clusters. Methodologies for sparsifying graphs include random edge sampling (Karger, 1994, Tumminello et al., 2005) or complex network backbone detection (Glattfelder and Battiston, 2009). However, as these approaches are designed to identify most interesting edges, or construct spanning-tree-like network backbones, they are less suited to preserve community structures (Satuluri et al., 2011). In addition, methods such as network backbone detection becomes increasingly computationally complex for large network structures (Hamann et al., 2016). Other approaches use edge centrality measures, such as edge betweeness centrality (Newman and Girvan, 2004). The betweeness centrality is proportional to the number of shortest paths between any two nodes in the network passing through an edge. As a consequence, edges with a high betweeness centrality can be seen as  bottlenecks in the network. Therefore, they are more likely to represent inter-cluster edges, which should be filtered first. However one major disadvantage of the edge betweeness centrality measure is that it becomes prohibitively expensive for larger graphs (Newman and Girvan, 2004).

Here, we present a fast, highly scalable heuristic for iterative local graph sparsification and module detection. The main idea behind our sparsification algorithm is to retain edges that are likely to be part of the same cluster, i.e. intra-cluster edges, and, therefore, to remove those edges that connect modules, i.e. inter-cluster edges. Each sparsification step is followed by a clustering step. The procedure iterates until no more modules larger than a predefined size exist or the sparsification does not change the clustering any further. 


## Methods

### Subchallenge 1

Our approach recursively iterates graph sparsification and clustering until convergence, i.e. until no more graph sparsification is possible or no more modules of a predefined size exist. To identify intra cluster edges, Satuluri et al. (Satuluri et al., 2011) proposed to rank edges using a Jaccard similarity coefficient, based on the assumption that an edge is likely to lie within a module if its adjacent nodes have a high overlap in mutual edges. Here, we use the inverse log-weighted similarity of the edge's adjacent two nodes. It denotes the number of common neighbors of both nodes, weighted by the inverse logarithm of their degrees. We use this measure over the Jaccard similarity, as it is based on the assumption that two vertices should be considered more similar if they share a low-degree common neighbor, given that high-degree common neighbors are more likely to have occurred by chance (Adamic, 2003). The algorithm, as described in pseudo code below, first performs an initial clustering on the full graph G. In addition, a similarity matrix S is formed, computing the inverse log-weighted similarity, over all nodes V. The clustering results are analyzed, retaining all predicted modules within a given size, i.e. a maximum of 100 genes for this challenge. All larger modules are subsequently sparsified and subsequently clustered until convergence. Per large module, the similarity matrix is evaluated, removing all edges in the module specific subgraph, with a similarity coefficient below a specific threshold. This threshold is given as a percentage based cutoff regarding the module specific similarity cumulative density function. This makes our sparsification approach local and adaptive to each individual module. A local similarity threshold is preferred over a global one given that various clusters may have different densities. As a consequence, a global threshold might therefore retain far many more edges in the denser clusters, disconnecting the less dense clusters (Satuluri et al., 2011). For subsequent module detection, we choose the infomap algorithm because of its accuracy, scalability and computational complexity (Yang, 2016), although any other clustering algorithm or combinations could be used as well.

### Subchallenge 2

First, we applied the approach as described for subchallenge 1 for all of the 6 individual networks. Subsequently, we formed an ensemble clustering estimating the posterior probability p that two genes fall into the same cluster. We used a threshold on the posterior probability of p > 0.55 to make sure that genes are hard clustered, i.e. only group to single clusters. 

## Discussion

Given the scarcity of graph sparsification approaches in R, in contrast to a plethora of state of the art community detection algorithms, our goal is to build our approach as a one stop solution in R that can do network pre-processing and clustering in one function call. For the competition we used two different sparsification thresholds, i.e. 80 % for the protein interaction, signal and cancer networks, as well as 95% for the coexpression and homology networks. These selection were based on visual inspection of the clusters, with respect to the initial network densities and the resulting number and sizes of clusters. Having entered the competition only within its last week, we see our approach as a conceptual prototype that focuses on speed as much as accuracy. In the future, we would like to evaluate the impact of forming an ensemble model over several clustering algorithms within our framework.
